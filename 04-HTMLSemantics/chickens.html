    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird">bird</a>, domesticated from the red
        junglefowl
        of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are
        kept as pets or for cockfighting.</p>
    <p>Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and an
        annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There
        are
        numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.</p>

    <h2>Dispersal</h2>
    <h3>Americas</h3>
    <p>The possibility that domestic chickens were in the Americas before Western contact is debated by researchers, but
        blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens. A
        lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it
        difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic
        analysis
        of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area.<sup>[62]</sup> Chicken
        bones from the
        Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile were radiocarbon dated as pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis suggested they
        were related to prehistoric populations in Polynesia.[47][48] However, further study of the same bones cast
        doubt on
        the findings.[63][64]</p>

    <h2>Use by humans</h2>
    <h3>As pets</h3>
    <p>Keeping chickens as pets became increasingly popular in the 2000s[88] among urban and suburban residents.[89]
        Many
        people obtain chickens for their egg production but often name them and treat them as any other pet like cats or
        dogs. Chickens provide companionship and have individual personalities. While many do not cuddle much, they will
        eat
        from one's hand, jump onto one's lap, respond to and follow their handlers, as well as show affection.[90][91]
        Chickens are social, inquisitive, intelligent[92] birds, and many people find their behaviour entertaining.[93]
        Certain breeds, such as silkies and many bantam varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as
        good
        pets around children with disabilities.[94]</p>
